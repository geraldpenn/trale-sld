Required libraries
==================

The JAR files of external Java libraries go into the "lib" subdirectory of the
project directory. Here is the list of required libraries and where to get them:

* log4j 1.2.15, http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html
* gralej, http://code.google.com/p/gralej/



Building
========

It is recommended to use Apache Ant to build the project. To automatize this
with Eclipse, go to Project Properties -> Builders, add an "Ant Builder" and
specify build.xml in the project directory as the build file for this builder.

Unlike Eclipse, the build file takes care of copying log4j.properties from the
"etc" directory to the "bin" directory in order to enable logging.
