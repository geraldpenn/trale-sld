lc-parse-gui - a left-corner parser with graphical debugger
(c) 2009 Johannes Dellert
---------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRES: SiCStus Prolog 3 installed with Jasper extension (Java interface)

USAGE:

- start sicstus, load parser
	$sicstus
	?- ['lc-parser-gui.pl'].
	
- load grammar; for English sample grammar:
	?- ['test-grammar-en.pl].
	
- parse sentences or phrases,e.g.
	?- parse(s,[the,dog,chases,the,cat]).

a Java Window will pop up with a decision tree visualization and a stack inspection component

functionality of the buttons:
	- Continue: 	equivalent to "creep" in usual Prolog tracer
	- Reject:		equivalent to "fail" in usual Prolog tracer
	- Confirm:  	no backtracing beyond this point (introduces a cut)
	- AutoComplete: automatically Continue as fast as possible
	- Abort:		self-explanatory; frees the prolog process
	
Previous stack states during the parsing process can be inspected by clicking on decision tree nodes.

Symbol colours in decision tree:
	- Red: 			this branch cut by the user using "Reject"
	- Green:		this branch was confirmed by the user; no backtracking above this point
	- White:		defualt colour for continued steps
