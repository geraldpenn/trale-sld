lc-parse-gui - a left-corner parser with graphical debugger
(c) 2009 Johannes Dellert
============================================================================

REQUIRES: 

- SiCStus Prolog 3 installed with Jasper extension (Java interface)
- Java Version 1.6.0.12 or higher
- older versions of Sun Java 6 have a good chance to work after recompiling the Java classes under ./src
  and replacing the class files under ./bin with the resulting class files

USAGE:

- start sicstus, load parser
	$sicstus
	?- ['lc-parser-gui.pl'].
	
- load grammar; for English sample grammar:
	?- ['test-grammar-en.pl].
	
- parse sentences or phrases,e.g.
	?- parse(s,[the,dog,chases,the,cat]).
	?- parse(vp,[amuses,the,cats,near,the,elephant]).

- a Java Window will pop up with a decision tree visualization and a stack inspection component

- functionality of the buttons:
	- Continue: 	equivalent to "creep" in usual Prolog tracer
	- Reject:		equivalent to "fail" in usual Prolog tracer
	- Confirm:  	no backtracing beyond this point (introduces a cut)
	- AutoComplete: automatically Continue as fast as possible
	- Abort:		self-explanatory; frees the prolog process
	
- previous stack states during the parsing process can be inspected by clicking on decision tree nodes

- symbol colours in decision tree:
	- Red: 			this branch cut by the user using "Reject"
	- Green:		this branch was confirmed by the user; no backtracking above this point
	- White:		default colour for continued steps
	
KNOWN ISSUES:

- 	sometimes, the decision tree visualisation will flicker in the beginning; 
	this is due to a bug in Swing for which we do not yet have a workaround;
	it helps to drag some other window over the LCParseGUI window, or to minimize and maximize it once
