#summary How to install and run TRALE with trale-sld.

= Requirements =

  * Java, version 1.6.0.12 or higher
  * SICStus Prolog 3, with aforementioned Java specified during installation

= Building =

If you received a TRALE distribution including trale-sld (typically in the form of a compressed archive that unpacks to a directory named {{{trale}}}, you can skip this section. Otherwise, you need to build trale-sld and patch TRALE, which is quite an imposition. You need

  * to be on a UNIX-like system with a Bash shell and Apache Ant installed
  * check out both <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gralej/">Gralej</a> and trale-sld from their respective Subversion repositories
  * obtain a current version of TRALE
  * set the environment variables {{{GRALEJ_TRUNK_DIR}}}, {{{TRALESLD_TRUNK_DIR}}}, {{{TRALESLD_TRALE_ORIG_DIR}}}, {{{TRALESLD_TRALE_DIST_DIR}}} as described in the comments in the plop script that comes with trale-sld

Then you should be ready to create a TRALE version equipped with the trale-sld patches - by running aforementioned plop script. It will be put into the location you specified ({{{$TRALESLD_TRALE_DIST_DIR}}}).

= Running the graphical debugger =

Start TRALE using the {{{trale}}} script as usual, but with the additional option {{{-d}}}. This will ensure that once a parse is started using TRALE's source-level debugger, the graphical interface will be started. Here's what you could enter at the TRALE command prompt to try out trale-sld:

{{{
ale_flag(debugger,_,on).    % to switch the debugger on
dcompile_gram(theory).      % to compile a grammar, assuming that it is there under
                            % the name of theory.pl in the present working directory
drec[she,walks].            % to parse this sentence, should fire up the GUI
}}}
