#summary changes in the TRALE system made for the SLD

This page lists the changes made to the TRALE system made for the benefit of trale-sld.

= interp.pl =

cf. http://code.google.com/p/trale-sld/source/browse/trunk/trale/debugger/interp.pl.diff

Caveat: More changes may be required here in the future, e.g. concerning the functionality of new buttons.

The changes consist in providing 12 new hooks that clients can implement to get notified of the progress of the parsing process. trale-sld's implementation of these hooks is in tralesld_hooks.pl.

{{{
announce_parse_begin_hook(+Words)
}}}
Called with the list of words at the beginning of a parsing process.

{{{
announce_parse_end_hook
}}}
Called at the end of the parsing process.

{{{
announce_abort_hook.
}}}
Called when the user aborts the parsing process.

{{{
announce_solution_found_hook(+Words,+FS,+Residue,+Index)
}}}
Called with the list of words, the root FS of the solution, the residue, and the index of the top chart edge when a solution is found. This hook will become obsolete once trale-sld is modified to properly use the {{{portray_cat/5}}} hook.

{{{
announce_step_hook(+Command,+Line,+Goal,+StepID)
}}}
Called before entering a step through the call port for the first time (not when a step is Retried). `StepID` is a unique integer that identifies the step.

{{{
announce_call_hook(+StepID,+Command,+Line,+Goal)
announce_exit_hook(+StepID,+Command,+Line,+Goal)
announce_fail_hook(+StepID,+Command,+Line,+Goal)
announce_finished_hook(+StepID,+Command,+Line,+Goal)
announce_redo_hook(+StepID,+Command,+Line,+Goal)
}}}
Called at the respective port of a step.

{{{
announce_edge_added_hook(+N,+Left,+Right,+RuleName)
}}}
Called when an edge is added to the chart.

{{{
announce_edge_retrieved_hook(+Number)
}}}
Called when an edge is retrieved from the chart.

{{{
get_reply_hook(-Code)
}}}
Called to get the next debugger command from the GUI. If not implemented, then a command is obtained from the keyboard using {{{get_code/1}}}.
