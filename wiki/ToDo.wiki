Enhancements in *bold face* are planned for the next milestone prototype (July 2009).

Kilian
  * *survey editors, integrate one*
  * *run GUI changes in separate thread (don't make TRALE wait for GUI to finish)*
  * *database as drop-in replacement for simple DataStores*
  * stop ignoring empty categories in tree fragment display (current rationale: different offset <=> different daughter)
  * replace current FS visualization with tree fragments for rule applications
  * get Grale hooks/Gralej to show the whole tree as a parse result
  * make "empty" re-entrancy gray

Johannes
  * *implement GUI changes from Gerald's wish list*
  * *undocking of windows*
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind

Together
  * *variable bindings*
  * *blocked goals*
  * *maybe: breakpoints on code lines*
  * make control buttons more functional
  * think of a good way to display residues
  * give GUI information about the grammar in a suitable format, then remove hack concerning the maximal width of the chart (currently: 2x length of words list)
  * introduce a special visualization for nodes that are Redone: their children should all represent the *same step* as the parent, but with *different bindings* (currently non-successful bindings are lost). Parent should have the same bindings as the child the most recently opened branch.
  * more systematic notification and treatment of end of parsing (more than one result, no result...)
