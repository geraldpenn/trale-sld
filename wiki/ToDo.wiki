Kilian
  * trale-sld switch in TRALE startup script
  * disentangle TRALE's data structures (FSs, residues...) and prepare for handover
  * implement handover (possibly simulating a stream with Jasper to ease reuse of ghooks.pl)
  * find out how to find out which non-leftmost daughters are used by a rule application, give GUI this information
  * make "empty" re-entrancy unclickable (and grey, maybe)
  * make dependencies between ghooks.pl and tralesld_hooks.pl more transparent
  * notification of end of parsing

Johannes
  * integrate feature structure display
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind
  * add data structure for dependencies between edges

Together
  * make control buttons more functional
  * improve chart display
  * provide redo visualization in decision tree
  * distinguish forced fail from normal fail
  * think of a good way to display residues
  * give GUI information about the grammar in a suitable format, then remove hack concerning the maximal width of the chart (currently: 2x length of words list)
