Kilian
  * enable handover of tagged FSs (tweak portray_fs/11)
  * disentangle TRALE's data structures (FSs, residues...) and prepare for handover
  * get the Grale hooks to portray FSs with top-level re-entrancies correctly, get Gralej to display them in case it can't do that yet
  * get Grale hooks/Gralej to show the whole tree as a parse result
  * find out how to find out which non-leftmost daughters are used by a rule application, give GUI this information
  * make "empty" re-entrancy gray

Johannes
  * integrate feature structure display
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind
  * add data structure for dependencies between edges

Together
  * make control buttons more functional
  * distinguish forced fail from normal fail
  * think of a good way to display residues
  * give GUI information about the grammar in a suitable format, then remove hack concerning the maximal width of the chart (currently: 2x length of words list)
  * introduce a special visualization for nodes that are Redone: their children should all represent the *same step* as the parent, but with *different bindings* (currently non-successful bindings are lost). Parent should have the same bindings as the child the most recently opened branch.
  * more systematic notification and treatment of end of parsing (more than one result, no result...)
