Enhancements in *bold face* are planned for the next milestone prototype (July 2009).

Kilian
  * *display of tree fragments*
  * *survey editors, integrate one*
  * *database as drop-in replacement for simple DataStores*
  * run GUI changes in separate thread, don't make TRALE wait for GUI to finish (tentative, first experiments didn't yield any positive results)
  * stop ignoring empty categories in tree fragment display (current rationale: different offset <=> different daughter)
  * improve tree fragment display
    * display mother categories
    * show the whole tree as a parse result
    * show nodes uncollapsed
    * better unfilling?

Johannes
  * *implement GUI changes from Gerald's wish list*
  * *undocking of windows*
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind

Together
  * *track variable bindings*
  * *display blocked goals*
  * *maybe: breakpoints on code lines*
  * make control buttons more functional
  * think of a good way to display residues
  * give GUI information about the grammar in a suitable format, then remove hack concerning the maximal width of the chart (currently: 2x length of words list)
  * introduce a special visualization for nodes that are Redone: their children should all represent the *same step* as the parent, but with *different bindings* (currently non-successful bindings are lost). Parent should have the same bindings as the child the most recently opened branch.
  * more systematic notification and treatment of end of parsing (more than one result, no result...)
