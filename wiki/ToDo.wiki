  * disentangle TRALE's data structures (FSs, residues...) and prepare for handover

Johannes
  * integrate feature structure display
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind

Together
  * make control buttons functional
  * improve chart display
  * transition from call tree to decision tree
