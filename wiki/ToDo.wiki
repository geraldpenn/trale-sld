Enhancements in *bold face* are planned for the next milestone prototype (July 2009).

Kilian
  * *survey editors, integrate one*
  * *database as drop-in replacement for simple DataStores*
  * stop ignoring empty categories in tree fragment display (current rationale: different offset <=> different daughter)
  * improve tree fragment display
    * improve substructure highlighting
      * currently breaks re-entrancies, fix
      * extend to daughters
      * handle functional descriptions, constraints, relational attachments, blocked goals...
    * after parsing, show the whole tree
    * show nodes uncollapsed
    * better unfilling
  * enable reuse of JVM across parsing processes, don't exit Prolog when TraleSLD window is closed

Johannes
  * *implement GUI changes from Gerald's wish list*
  * *undocking of windows*
  * keep profiling and breakpoint system in mind

Together
  * *track variable bindings*
  * *display blocked goals*
  * maybe: breakpoints on code lines
  * make control buttons more functional
  * think of a good way to display residues
  * give GUI information about the grammar in a suitable format, then remove hack concerning the maximal width of the chart (currently: 2x length of words list)
  * introduce a special visualization for nodes that are Redone: their children should all represent the *same step* as the parent, but with *different bindings* (currently non-successful bindings are lost). Parent should have the same bindings as the child the most recently opened branch.
  * more systematic notification and treatment of end of parsing (more than one result, no result...)
  * call tree branches triggered by constraints should be visually recognizable in control flow graph
  * call tree branches triggered by the unblocking of goals should be connected to where they were blocked
